# 📜 CFG Simulator (Context-Free Grammar Simulator)

A powerful and interactive simulator for **Context-Free Grammars (CFGs)**, allowing users to define grammars, generate strings, visualize derivations, and check membership efficiently. This tool is useful for students, researchers, and developers working with formal languages and automata theory.

---

## 🚀 Features

✅ **Grammar Definition** – Define custom CFGs with production rules.  
✅ **String Validation** – Check if a string belongs to the language.  
✅ **Step-by-Step Derivations** – Interactive breakdown of how a string is derived.  
✅ **Real-time Simulation** – Test CFGs dynamically in a user-friendly interface.
